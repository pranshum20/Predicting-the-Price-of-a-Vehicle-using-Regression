This project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates the market value of vehicles based on their specifications, insurance risk ratings, and normalized losses. By leveraging various regression techniques, the project seeks to offer reliable price predictions that benefit both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

The project was developed using Google Colab, with Python as the primary programming language. Several essential libraries were utilized, including NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization, and Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning models. These tools provided a robust platform for data processing, visualization, and model training.

The methodology followed a structured approach, beginning with data collection. The dataset used in this project contained 205 records and 26 features, encompassing various vehicle specifications. The data preprocessing phase involved handling missing values, cleaning the data, and performing feature engineering to enhance the dataset's quality. Following this, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to visualize trends, patterns, and correlations within the data, offering valuable insights for model development.

Several regression models were trained, including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and KNeighbors Regressor. These models were evaluated based on their R-squared value and mean squared error to identify the best-performing model. The Decision Tree Regressor emerged as the most effective, achieving an R-squared score of 0.809 and a mean squared error of 6,988,469.96, which translated to an accuracy of 80%. This model was selected for the final vehicle price prediction.

The code implementation in this project includes importing the necessary libraries, loading and preprocessing the dataset, visualizing the data, training multiple regression models, comparing their performance, and fine-tuning the best model through hyperparameter optimization. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the Decision Tree Regressor in predicting vehicle prices, providing a valuable tool for stakeholders in the automotive market.
